OSMC manages firmware and kernel updates on your Raspberry Pi automatically

As a result, rpi-update isn't included with OSMC. While the tool can be downloaded manually,
we don't recommend this

If a feature is missing and you'd like to see it included in OSMC, please start a forum post at
https://discourse.osmc.tv

For information on how to keep your OSMC system up to date and get the best OSMC experience,
